    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy covers the <i>Mailto: for Gmailâ„¢</i> extension for the Google Chrome browser.</p>

    <p>It was last updated on the 10th of November 2017.</p>

    <h2>Data collection</h2>
    <p>The extension does not collect or transmit any information, personal or otherwise.</p>

    <p>The extension's settings are stored only on your local machine, and are never transmitted anywhere.</p>

    <p>This extension does not contain any adverts or tracking components.</p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>The extension works by scanning pages you visit for mailto: links, and converting those it finds to point directly to
        a Gmail (or Google Apps mail) compose window. It operates solely within your browser, and does not require sending
        or receiving any information.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:contact@ilikesleeping.co.uk?subject=Hello">contact@ilikesleeping.co.uk</a> if you have any questions.</p>
